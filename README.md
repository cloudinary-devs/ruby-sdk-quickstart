# ruby-sdk-quickstart

This small Ruby project shows the finished result of the [Ruby SDK Quick Start](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/ruby_rails_quickstart) instructions provided in the Cloudinary documentation.

Feel free to fork this project and use it as a quick way to get started playing with the Cloudinary Ruby/Rails SDK. It can be used in any Ruby or Ruby on Rails dev environment.

You'll need to copy the `config copy.rb` file, rename it to `config.rb` and then replace the sample credentials with your Cloudinary account credentials before you can run the `quickstart.rb`file.

Keep in mind that the intention of this quick start project is to help developers quickly get started using several common Cloudinary features. It doesn't necessarily employ coding best practices and the code isn't intended for production.
