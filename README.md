# ruby-sdk-quickstart

This small Ruby project shows the finished result of the [Ruby SDK Quick Start](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/ruby_rails_quickstart) instructions provided in the Cloudinary documentation.

Feel free to fork this project and use it as a quick way to get started playing with the Cloudinary Ruby/Rails SDK. However, keep in mind that the intention of this code is to help developers quickly get started using several common Cloudinary features. It doesn't necessarily employ coding best practices and the code isn't intended for production.
